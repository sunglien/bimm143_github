## The PDB database

The main repository of biomolecular strucutre data is called the PDB found at: https://www.rcsb.org


Let's see what this database contains. I went to PDB > Analyze > PDB Statistics > By Exp method and molecular type.

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```


>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
```

The comma in these number is causing them to be read as character rather than numeric.

I can fix this by replacing "," for nothing "" with the `sub()` function:

```{r}
x <- pdbstats$X.ray
sum(as.numeric(sub(",","", x)))
```

Or I can use the **readr** package and the `read_csv()`

```{r}
library(readr)

pdbstats <- read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```


I want to clean the column names so they are all lower case and don't have spcaes in them.

```{r}
colnames(pdbstats)
```



```{r}
library(janitor)

df <- clean_names(pdbstats)
df
```
Total number of X-ray Structures
```{r}
sum(df$x_ray)
```

Total Number of structures
```{r}
sum(df$total)
```


Percent of X-ray structures
```{r}
sum(df$x_ray)/sum(df$total) * 100
```

Percent of EM structures
```{r}
sum(df$em)/ sum(df$total) * 100
```



## 2. Using Mol*

The main Mol* homepage at: https://molstar.org/viewer/ 
We can input our own PDB files or just give it a PDB database accession code (4 letter PDB code)

>Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

## 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R

We can use the **bio3d** package for structural bioinformatics to read PDB data into R


```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```


>Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?

```{r}
length(pdbseq(pdb))
```

>Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues?

MK1

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

2chains A and B

Looking at the `PDB` object in more detail
```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```
```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```


Let's try a new function not yet in the bio3d package. It requires the **r3dmol** package that we need to install with `install.packages("r3dmol")` and `install.packages("shiny")`


```{r}
library(r3dmol)
source("https://tinyurl.com/viewpdb")
#view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor= "pink")
```






## 4. Predicting functional dynamics

We can use the `nma()` function in bio3d to predict the large-scale functional motions of biomolecules.

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Write out a trajectory of the predicted molecular motion:
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
